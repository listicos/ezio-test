/**
 A protocol that represents authentication input which carries the information from user.
 <p>
 
 @warning As biometric fingerprint methods may request user to present its fingerprint through the TouchId UI,
 it is recommended that developer avoid to call these methods on the main thread, to limit the risk of blocking
 or freezing the handset. Developer should use the biometric fingerprint methods on a separate thread, as 
 describe in the example below
 
 <code>
 // dispatch a new thread to deactivate non silently
 
 dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH, 0), ^{
    
    [token deactivateAuthModeWithInput:bioFpAuthInput error:&error];
 
    //some logic
 
    //update UI
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue (), ^{
        â€¦
    }
 }
 </code>
 
 @warning In iOS8, two calls in a row of biometric methods; using the TouchID UI to authenticate the user,
 will not work. The second call will return an error code without presenting the TouchID UI to the user.
 So application should respect this constraint, and for example, not try to compute two OTP consecutively. 
 However, if it is really needed, developers can add a sleep instruction (of 1 second or more) between the 
 two biometric calls to make it work.
